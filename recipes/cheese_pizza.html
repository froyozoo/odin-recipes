    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the bread flour, sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Fit mixer with dough hook.</li>
        <li>Turn mixer on low speed and add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil; beat until the dough forms into a ball around the hook. If the dough is super sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
        <li>Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.</li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm area and let it double in size, about 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Wrap one dough well in saran wrap and place in the freezer for a later use.</li>
        <li>Place the dough you'll be using on a piece of plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-flame. Add the onion, celery and garlic and saute until soft; about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and tomato paste and stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients and bring to slow simmer. Simmer for 45 minutes. Remove from heat and allow sauce to cool.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce on pizza dough, as needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cheese:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate cheese, then place it in a large, clean bowl. Place bowl in the freezer for at least 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembling the pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees (F).</li>
        <li>Roll dough out to a large circle (about 12 inches). Pour a 1/4 cup of sauce in the center and spread it around evenly. Add cheese.</li>
        <li>Place pizza in the oven to bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is set and the cheese is bubbling. Cut into slices and serve at once!</li>
    </ol>
